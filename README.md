Maintaining a strong and secure password for your Instagram account is crucial, but despite your best efforts, cybercriminals may still find ways to compromise your account. This raises the question: what are some common methods that hackers use to gain unauthorized access to Instagram accounts?

What is the frequency of Instagram account hacking per year?
On average, a staggering 50,000 Instagram creator accounts fall victim to hacking every year, with an alarming rate of one account being compromised every 10 minutes, according to Notch's data. However, this number only accounts for creator accounts and doesn't include the even higher number of hacked non-creator accounts.

Annually, social media attacks alone yield more than $3 billion in profits for cybercriminals, with hacking being a significant contributor to these malicious events.

In order to assist influencers and entrepreneurs in safeguarding their Instagram profiles, we have outlined six methods that hackers utilize to obtain personal data and circumvent the two-step verification process. What are the ways in which Instagram accounts become compromised?

Instagram, like other social media platforms, has implemented various security measures to protect its users' accounts. One of the most significant security features is two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. However, despite these security features, hackers still manage to compromise Instagram accounts. So, how do they do it?

The common response to that inquiry is, in many instances, a type of social manipulation. Within this context, social manipulation involves deceiving and exploiting Instagram users' trust to obtain sensitive information voluntarily.

1. Untrue notifications of copyright infringement.

The strategy.

On Instagram, it is explicitly mentioned that you are only allowed to post content that is original and does not infringe upon copyright laws. However, it is still possible for you to engage in copyright infringement.

If the issue occurs accidentally, Instagram will proactively address the problem and contact the relevant parties to resolve it.

Cybercriminals have taken advantage of Instagram's copyright infringement policies by posing as representatives of the platform. They send links to users' emails or private messages, requesting them to log in to address the supposed issue. This is a common tactic used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to users' accounts, as demonstrated by a recent attempt to hack @wandertears' account.

Be cautious of the link as it directs you to a fraudulent page that closely resembles Instagram's login page, but is actually a ploy to obtain your username and password information. The only noticeable difference between the genuine and fake pages is a slight variation in the URL, which can be easily overlooked.

Cybercriminals often redirect you to one of Instagram's authentic FAQ pages that covers the subject of copyright infringement, as a way to avoid arousing suspicion.

The resolution.

You have a few options to confirm the authenticity of Instagram messages you receive. Initially, important notifications from Instagram are typically sent directly through the account interface or via email. If you receive a direct message regarding your account, it should not be trusted, regardless of whether the username contains the word "Instagram".

Instagram has introduced a feature that enables you to view a record of all security and login email addresses associated with your account. Before opening any suspicious emails, you can check this section to verify its authenticity.

Navigate to the Security & Emails section of your Instagram profile that you are unable to locate the email in question, it is advisable to promptly remove it.
